PiggyBank - a friendly introduction to credit score and loans for young adults. We all engage in informal money lending, by borrowing lunch money or lending a friend money for buying presents. Borrowing money from banks and engaging in prudent borrowing practices is certainly more beneficial than the informal practice: greater quantity of resources can be accessed and credit score improved. However, young adults ages 16-19 do not have a significant credit history, if any, due to the age requirement for credit cards being 18. That doesn't mean life is without costs; just $25 could make the difference between your science competition submission becoming a competition winner. But, your budget is done. 

Enter PiggyBank. PiggyBank is an app that connects you with peers interested in funding and borrowing small sums for projects. Whether you are interested in supporting a classmate's business or affording a trip to the State History Bowl competition, PiggyBank is for you. Describe what your interests are or the projects you are seeking to fund in your profile. Choose how wide you would like your circle to be. If you'd like, include a way to contact you for more information and the code other users need to connect with you, or keep your connection code and info off of your profile so that only the users who already know you and can communicate with you can connect on this app.
